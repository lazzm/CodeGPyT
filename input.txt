Show a tkinter window that is 500x300 and not resizable.
It should be black background and show a square.
The square should move and bounce off the edges. 
A bit like how the DVD logo does in its famous animation.
When the square hits the edge, it changes colour to one of these colours, but will be different from the current colour.
Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, White
It should move quite slowly.
